# mall_customers_spending_score_prediction
In a mall ,they provide a membership card to their clients that shows the customer info in it .
When clients buy with that card ,the mall recieves a spending score according to that data and takes values 
between 1 and 100.

The spending score closer to 2 shows 'less declined spends' and closer to 100 shows 'more declined spends'.

#GOAL:

To segment their clients in 2 different groups based on their Annual income and Spending Score.

The data is clustered using two different clustering methods ,i.e;

1.Hierachical clustering 

2.k-means clustering.
